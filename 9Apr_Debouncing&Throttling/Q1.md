Debouncing:
Imagine this—you're typing in a search bar, and every keystroke triggers the system to fetch suggestions. Without control, the system would be overloaded with requests. That’s where debouncing comes in. It’s like saying to the system, “Hey, wait until I stop typing for a second before doing anything.” Debouncing ensures that functions only run after a pause, avoiding unnecessary calls and keeping things efficient.
Where You’d Use It:
- Search boxes: Instead of fetching results for every letter typed, debounce waits until you pause before sending one request.
- Form validation: If you’re checking email or username availability, debounce prevents repeated API calls while the user is still typing.
- Window resizing: Rather than triggering an event constantly as the window resizes, debounce ensures your function runs only after resizing stops.
- Preventing multiple form submissions: Rapid clicks on the submit button are ignored, only processing the final click.



Throttling:
Now picture this—you’re scrolling through a long webpage, and the system is trying to load more content as you go. If it responded to every pixel you scroll, chaos would ensue! Throttling fixes this by limiting the system’s actions: “I’ll only load content once every X milliseconds, no matter how many times you scroll.” It’s about steady and controlled execution.
Where You’d Use It:
- Infinite scroll: Limits how often new content is loaded while scrolling.
- Mouse tracking: For dynamic interactions, like tooltips, throttling ensures smooth updates without overwhelming the system.
- Window resizing (live updates): When layouts change dynamically during resizing, throttling lets functions run at controlled intervals.
- API call rate limits: Keeps requests within allowed frequency, ensuring your app doesn’t hit rate limits.



Key Difference:
- Debouncing: Waits for a pause in activity before taking action. Perfect for reacting only after someone finishes doing something.
- Throttling: Regulates how frequently an action is performed during continuous activity. Ideal for maintaining steady control while events happen in real-time.
